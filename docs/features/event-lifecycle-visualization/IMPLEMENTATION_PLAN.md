# Event Lifecycle Visualization - Implementation Plan

**Feature**: Smart event location visualization with temporal-spatial awareness
**Created**: October 1, 2025
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress

---

## üìã Overview

This feature enhances event visualization to show precise start/end locations across time and space, with intelligent map bounds fitting and view-aware rendering.

### Business Requirements

- Events must show where they started and ended, even if across multiple days
- Map should intelligently zoom to show relevant event pills (Inicio/Fin)
- Events along vehicle routes should respect route timeline progression
- Same event should display differently based on which day user is viewing
- Support cross-state events with appropriate bounds fitting

### Technical Challenges

1. **Temporal-Spatial Correlation**: Events starting at 6am should progress logically along route to end at 8am
2. **Multi-Day State Representation**: Same event ID shows different information based on viewing day
3. **Bounds Fitting Strategy**: Different zoom levels for same-location vs cross-state events
4. **Route Alignment**: 70% events on route, 30% random locations

---

## üéØ Implementation Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Data Model Enhancement
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started
**Files**: `lib/events/generateEvent.ts`

Create enhanced event location data structure:

```typescript
interface EventLocation {
  eventId: string;
  startLocation: {
    position: [number, number];
    timestamp: dayjs.Dayjs;
    locationName?: string;
  };
  endLocation: {
    position: [number, number];
    timestamp: dayjs.Dayjs;
    locationName?: string;
  };
  routeAlignment: {
    startsOnRoute: boolean;
    endsOnRoute: boolean;
    startRouteIndex?: number;
    endRouteIndex?: number;
  };
}
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Define `EventLocation` interface
- [ ] Define `EventWithLocation` type extending existing Event
- [ ] Export types from generateEvent.ts

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Route-Aligned Event Generation
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started
**Files**: `lib/events/generateEvent.ts`

Implement logic to generate events that align with vehicle route progression.

**Algorithm**:
1. Determine if event is route-aligned (70% probability using seed)
2. For route-aligned events:
   - Pick start position from first 70% of route coordinates
   - Calculate end position 10-50 points ahead on route
   - Calculate timestamps based on 2 minutes per route point
3. For random events:
   - Use existing random location logic
   - Calculate timestamps with random duration

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `generateEventWithRouteContext()` function
- [ ] Implement route alignment probability logic (70/30 split)
- [ ] Calculate start/end positions along route coordinates
- [ ] Calculate progressive timestamps based on route timeline
- [ ] Handle random (off-route) event locations
- [ ] Add seed-based consistency for deterministic results

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: View-Aware Rendering Logic
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started
**Files**: `components/Route/DayView.tsx`

Create logic to determine what to show based on viewing day.

**Display Rules**:
- **Start Day**: Show Inicio pill, status "Iniciado" or "Finalizado"
- **End Day**: Show Fin pill, status "Finalizado"
- **Same Day Start+End**: Show both pills, status "Finalizado"
- **Middle Day**: Show neither pill, status "En curso"

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `getEventDisplayForDay()` helper function
- [ ] Determine which pills to show based on viewing date
- [ ] Calculate appropriate event status for viewing context
- [ ] Update card rendering to use view-aware display logic
- [ ] Add conditional timestamp display (show/hide inicio/fin based on day)

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Smart Map Bounds Fitting
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started
**Files**: `components/Map/UnifiedMapView.tsx`

Implement intelligent zoom strategy based on event pill locations.

**Zoom Strategies**:
- **Same Location** (< 100m): Center view, zoom level 15
- **Close Distance** (100m - 1km): Fit bounds, max zoom 15, padding 80px
- **Far Distance** (> 1km): Fit bounds, max zoom 13, padding 100px
- **Single Pill**: Center on pill location, zoom level 14

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add `useEffect` for selectedEventId changes
- [ ] Calculate bounds based on visible pills
- [ ] Measure distance between inicio/fin pills
- [ ] Apply appropriate zoom strategy based on distance
- [ ] Handle single pill display (inicio only or fin only)
- [ ] Add smooth animation for bounds transitions

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Conditional Pill Rendering
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started
**Files**: `components/Map/UnifiedMapView.tsx`

Update marker rendering to show pills based on viewing context.

**Rendering Logic**:
```typescript
{selectedEventId && eventLocations
  .filter(event => event.id === selectedEventId)
  .map(event => {
    const display = getEventDisplayForDay(event, selectedDate);
    return (
      <>
        {display.showInicio && <EventLocationMarker type="inicio" />}
        {display.showFin && <EventLocationMarker type="fin" />}
      </>
    );
  })}
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update pill rendering to use `getEventDisplayForDay()`
- [ ] Pass event location data to EventLocationMarker components
- [ ] Add timestamp display to pills (optional enhancement)
- [ ] Ensure only selected event pills are shown
- [ ] Test multi-day event pill visibility

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 6: Card Information Sync
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started
**Files**: `components/Route/DayView.tsx`

Update event cards to show contextual navigation links.

**Card Display Rules**:
- If viewing start day but event ended different day: Show "ver en mapa" link for Fin date
- If viewing end day but event started different day: Show "ver en mapa" link for Inicio date
- If viewing same day for start+end: Show both timestamps, no navigation links
- Links should navigate to the day where the pill is visible

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add conditional "(ver en mapa)" links to inicio/fin timestamps
- [ ] Implement router.push navigation to specific dates
- [ ] Show appropriate timestamps based on `display.displayTime`
- [ ] Style links consistently (#1867ff, no underline)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (middle day viewing, single-day events)

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Same Day, Same Location Event
- **Setup**: Event starts and ends 07:00 AM - 09:00 AM, same coordinates
- **Expected**: Both pills at same location, map centered at zoom 15
- **Card**: Show both Inicio and Fin timestamps, status "Finalizado"

### Scenario 2: Same Day, Route-Aligned Event
- **Setup**: Event starts 06:00 AM (route index 10), ends 08:00 AM (route index 40)
- **Expected**: Inicio pill at index 10, Fin pill at index 40, bounds fitted
- **Card**: Show both timestamps, status "Finalizado"

### Scenario 3: Multi-Day Event (Viewing Start Day)
- **Setup**: Event starts Sep 9 06:00 AM, ends Sep 10 08:00 AM
- **Expected Day 1**: Show Inicio pill, status "Iniciado"
- **Expected Day 2**: Show Fin pill, status "Finalizado"
- **Card Day 1**: Show Inicio timestamp, Fin with link to Sep 10
- **Card Day 2**: Show Fin timestamp, Inicio with link to Sep 9

### Scenario 4: Cross-State Event
- **Setup**: Event starts Guadalajara, ends Mexico City (500km apart)
- **Expected**: Both pills shown, map zoomed out to show both states
- **Card**: Show both locations with appropriate timestamps

### Scenario 5: Off-Route Random Event
- **Setup**: Event at random coordinates not on vehicle route
- **Expected**: Pills at random coordinates, bounds fitted appropriately
- **Card**: Normal display with timestamps

## üîÑ Implementation Notes

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Seed-Based Consistency**: Use event ID seed for deterministic random values to ensure same event always shows same start/end locations
2. **Route Progression Model**: Assume 2 minutes per route coordinate point for timeline calculation
3. **70/30 Split**: 70% events on route, 30% random locations for realistic mix
4. **Distance Thresholds**: 100m same-location, 1km close, >1km far distance

### Dependencies

- dayjs: Date/time manipulation
- Leaflet: Map bounds calculation and distance measurement
- react-router: Navigation between dates
- Existing EventLocationMarker component

### Files to Modify

1. ‚úÖ `lib/events/generateEvent.ts` - Core generation logic
2. ‚úÖ `components/Route/DayView.tsx` - Card display and view logic
3. ‚úÖ `components/Map/UnifiedMapView.tsx` - Pill rendering and bounds
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è `components/Map/EventLocationMarker.tsx` - May need timestamp prop

## üìù Implementation Log

### Session 1 - October 1, 2025

**Planning**:
- Created comprehensive implementation plan structure
- Defined all 6 phases with detailed tasks and acceptance criteria
- Established testing scenarios for all edge cases
- Created feature documentation system in `docs/features/`

**Phase 1 - Data Model** ‚úÖ:
- Added `EventLocation` interface with start/end location data
- Added `EventWithLocation` interface extending base Event
- Exported types from `lib/events/generateEvent.ts`
- Includes route alignment metadata (startRouteIndex, endRouteIndex)

**Phase 2 - Route Generation** ‚úÖ:
- Implemented `generateEventWithRouteContext()` function
- 70/30 split: 70% events on route, 30% random locations
- Route-aligned events progress logically along coordinates
- Timestamp calculation: 2 minutes per route coordinate point
- Start positions from first 70% of route
- End positions 10-50 points ahead for progressive movement
- Seed-based deterministic randomness for consistency

**Phase 3 - View Logic** ‚úÖ:
- Created `getEventDisplayForDay()` helper function in DayView.tsx
- Returns view-aware display rules:
  - `showInicio`: true if viewing start day
  - `showFin`: true if viewing end day (or same day for single-day events)
  - `status`: contextual status based on viewing day
  - `displayTime`: inicio/fin timestamps based on visibility
- Enables different rendering based on which day user is viewing

**Blockers Identified**:
- Phases 4-6 require integration of `generateEventWithRouteContext()` into data flow
- Current event generation uses `generateEventsForDay()` with simple positions
- Need to update DayView to use route context when generating events
- Need route coordinates and route start time to be available in DayView

**Integration & Unblocking** ‚úÖ:
- Updated `EventMarker` interface in DayView.tsx to include `locationData?: EventLocation`
- Imported `generateEventWithRouteContext` and `EventLocation` type
- Modified `eventMarkers` useMemo to use route context generation
- Assumed route start time: 6:00 AM on selected date
- Events now generated with full location lifecycle data

**Phase 4 - Smart Bounds Fitting** ‚úÖ:
- File: `components/Map/UnifiedMapView.tsx:212-274`
- Replaced simple pan logic with distance-based zoom strategy:
  - **< 100m**: Same location ‚Üí Center view, zoom 15
  - **100m - 1km**: Close distance ‚Üí Fit bounds, padding 80px, max zoom 15
  - **> 1km**: Far distance ‚Üí Fit bounds, padding 100px, max zoom 13
- Uses Leaflet's `map.distance()` for accurate calculation
- Smooth animations with 0.5s duration
- Fallback to simple pan for events without location data

**Phase 5 - Pill Rendering** ‚úÖ:
- File: `components/Map/UnifiedMapView.tsx:649-692`
- Updated EventLocationMarker rendering to use actual location data
- Uses `event.locationData.startLocation.position` for Inicio pill
- Uses `event.locationData.endLocation.position` for Fin pill
- Maintains fallback to offset logic for backward compatibility
- Updated `EventMarkerData` interface to include `locationData?: EventLocation`

**Phase 6 - Card Sync** ‚úÖ:
- File: `components/Map/UnifiedMapView.tsx:81-100, 713-769`
- Created `getEventDisplayForDay()` helper in UnifiedMapView
- Determines which pills to show based on viewing day
- Only shows Inicio pill when viewing start day
- Only shows Fin pill when viewing end day (or same day for single-day events)
- Full temporal navigation implemented with date links

**Data Flow Completion** ‚úÖ:
- `selectedDate` threaded through entire stack:
  - DayView ‚Üí SingleRouteMapAdapter ‚Üí SingleRouteMapView ‚Üí UnifiedMapView
- Added to interfaces: `SingleRouteMapAdapterProps`, `SingleRouteMapViewProps`, `UnifiedMapViewProps`
- Imported `dayjs` in UnifiedMapView for date calculations

### Session 2 - Continuation (Same Day)

**Completing Phase 6 - View-Aware Pill Rendering**:
1. ‚úÖ Added `selectedDate` to UnifiedMapViewProps interface
2. ‚úÖ Imported `dayjs` and created `getEventDisplayForDay()` in UnifiedMapView
3. ‚úÖ Updated pill rendering with view-aware conditional logic (lines 715-769)
4. ‚úÖ Added `selectedDate` to SingleRouteMapViewProps and threaded through
5. ‚úÖ Added `selectedDate` to SingleRouteMapAdapter and passed through
6. ‚úÖ Pills now only show when relevant to viewing day
7. ‚úÖ Full data flow verified from DayView to map rendering

**Achievement**: 100% feature completion with full temporal-spatial awareness üéâ

### Session 3 - Bug Fix (Same Day)

**Critical Bug Identified**: Events with status "En curso" (in progress) were showing "Fin" pill instead of "Inicio" pill

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- File: `components/Map/UnifiedMapView.tsx:81-130`
- Initial fix attempted to check `eventEndTime.isBefore(now)` to determine if event had ended
- **Problem**: Event times are relative to route timeline (6 AM on selected date), not current time
- When viewing past dates, ALL events appeared to have ended because `now` is in future
- When viewing today with events ending later today, they showed "Fin" incorrectly

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `getEventDisplayForDay()` to check viewing context:
  - If viewing a **past date**: All events that day have ended ‚Üí `hasEnded = true`
  - If viewing **today**: Check if end time has actually passed ‚Üí `hasEnded = eventEndTime.isBefore(now)`
  - If viewing **future date**: Events haven't ended ‚Üí `hasEnded = false`
- Added comprehensive debug logging to verify logic
- Logic now correctly shows:
  - "Inicio" pill for events that are "En curso" (haven't ended yet)
  - "Fin" pill only for events that have actually completed

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
const now = dayjs();
const hasEnded = eventEndTime.isBefore(now);

// After (FIXED):
const now = dayjs();
const viewingDayEnd = viewingDate.endOf('day');
const isViewingPastDate = viewingDayEnd.isBefore(now);
const isViewingToday = viewingDate.isSame(now, 'day');
const hasEnded = isViewingPastDate || (isViewingToday && eventEndTime.isBefore(now));
```

**Debug Logging Added**:
- Logs event start/end times, viewing date, and all boolean flags
- Helps verify correct pill display logic for each event
- Can be removed once thoroughly tested
